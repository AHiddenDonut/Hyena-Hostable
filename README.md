### ➜ How to colaborate here

> For any doubts here, contact Donut#4427 please.
> Follow the steps given below

Step 1: Fork & Clone the repository

```sh
$ git clone link-to-my-forked-repository.git hyenabot # usually link will be https://github.com/YourUserName/Hyena-Hostable
$ cd Hyena-Hostable
```

Step 2: Setup virtual environment
This can simply be done by doing the following:

```sh
$ virtualenv venv # Linux/mac

```

Step 3: Activating virtual environment and setting up dependencies

```sh
$ source ./venv/bin/activate  # Linux/mac # from root dir

$ venv\Scripts\activate.bat # Windows
```
Now our virtual env should be acitvated, time to install the packages.
```sh
(venv) pip install -U -r requirements.txt  # Linux/mac

(venv) py -m pip install -U -r requirements.txt # Windows
```
